 \chapter{The Standard Model of Particle Physics}
 
 
 
After closer investigation of cosmic radiation, many new particles were discovered, such as neutral Kaons \PKzero in 1947. As new techniques, such as particle accelerators were improved, this `Particle Zoo' became more and more confusing to physicists. In the 1960s and 70s, a new model emerged: the Standard Model which brought order to the apparent chaos. It did so by articulating the phenomenology of known fundamental interactions into a single self-consistent, locally gauge-invariant quantum field theory centered around electromagnetism (Quantum Electro-Dynamics or \textit{QED}), the strong nuclear force (Quantum Chromo-Dynamics or \textit{QCD}) and the weak nuclear force.

Those interactions are mediated by spin-1 particles, the so called \textit{vector-bosons}: the photon \Pgamma mediates QED, eight massless but coloured gluons \Pgluon mediate QCD and three massive bosons \PZ, \PWpm mediate the weak interaction. Finally a single spinless massive \textit{scalar boson}, the so called \textit{Higgs Boson} was observed in 2012 and allows for massive bosons and at least certain fermions to be massive.
Matter however is made of fermions, particle with spin $\frac{1}{2}$, those, in the Standard Model are classified as \textit{quarks} and \textit{leptons}.
The Standard Model was observed to hold  6 massive quarks, reacting to all three interactions, 3 charged leptons, sensitive to electromagnetism and the weak interaction, and 3 neutral leptons, \textit{neutrinos}, which only interact through the weak interaction. They can be found in Table \ref{tab:SM}.
