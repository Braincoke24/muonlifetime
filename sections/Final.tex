\section{On the day of the experiment}

\begin{itemize}

\item Preliminary test: Elementary particles, cosmic rays, muon production, polarization and decay, experiment apparatus, decay spectrums.

\item Setting up the electronics and PMT voltage, discriminators and gate lengths.

\item Testing the electronics and calibrating the time measurement through simulated muons using the pulse generator.

\item Starting the measurement.
\end{itemize}

The measurement takes one week. The ensuing analysis is to be done at home, using whichever tools are seen fit. It is recommended that students review the functionning of the electronics, especially coincidence units and the monoflop.
