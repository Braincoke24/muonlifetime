\section{Electronics description}


The different pieces of electronics used in this experiment are described here.

\subsection{Amplifier}

Amplifiers are an electronic device which is used to increase the amplitude of a signal through modulation of output voltage or current. The ratio between the output amplitude and the input amplitude is called the \textit{Gain} ($G$)
