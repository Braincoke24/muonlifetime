	journal = {Proceedings of the Physical Society},
	abstract = {The momentum spectrum of muons in the vertical cosmic ray flux at Durham has been measured for the momentum range 0.4-10 GeV/c. The measurements are based on some 191 000 trajectories. The bias introduced by the condition that the particles should be unaccompanied has been studied and found to be small.
The measurements on the momentum spectrum are compared with those of other workers and possible causes of the discrepancies are examined. It is concluded that the relative intensities are known with an accuracy to about 3% over the range 0.4-10 GeV/c.
The production spectrum of cosmic ray pions has been determined under the assumption that the sea-level muons all come from pions. Representing the spectrum as N(pπ) = Apπ-γ, γ is found to be constant and equal to 2.65, for pπ > 5 GeV/c. Below this momentum γ falls continuously and reaches the value 1.93 at a pion momentum of 1 GeV/c. The production spectrum agrees well with those given by Olbert in 1954 and by Puppi in 1956 above 3 GeV/c but has significantly lower intensity at lower momenta.}

abstract="When the surface of a solid is bombarded with charged particles of sufficient kinetic energy, emission of electrons by the solid may be observed. This phenomenon of secondary electron emission was discovered by Austin and Starke in 1902 in a study of the reflection of electrons by metals; they observed that under certain circumstances more electrons were emitted than were incident, indicating that the bombarding primary electrons liberate electrons from the solid.1 Unless otherwise stated, it will be assumed in the present chapter that the bombarding particles are electrons. However, emission of electrons may also result from bombardment with heavy charged particles such as ions.2 The theory of secondary emission under electron bombardment is completely different from that under ion bombardment. The reason is that in the former case the bombarding particles penetrate into the solid, thus producing a bulk effect; in the latter case, however, one deals essentially with a surface effect. For a survey of the field of secondary emission we refer to the bibliography at the end of this chapter. Some of the basic principles involved in the secondary emission process will now be discussed.",
